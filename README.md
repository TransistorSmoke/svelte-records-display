**Records Display**

Having just started learning Svelte, this is the first small project I created to practice the basic Svelte functionalities.
With a preset object array as a data source, each of these object elements is rendered dynamically as a card component. Each element can be deleted, though the functionality to edit the content has been disabled for now.

This is created with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JS and Svelte. Here is a working sample: https://svelte-records-check.netlify.app/
